Cubiquity for Unity3D depends on the Cubiquity voxel engine to handle voxel-related tasks. More information about Cubiquity can be found here:

Users of Cubiquity for Unity3D do not generally need to be concerned with the details of the underlying Cubiquity engine. However, the Cubiquity SDK does include a tool called 'ProcessVDB' which converts various data formats to Cubiquity's voxel database (.vdb) format. Details of using this tool can be found in the Cubiquity for Unity3D documentation under 'Main Principles' -> 'Obtaining Volume Data' -> 'Importing From External Sources'.
