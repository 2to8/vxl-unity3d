The online version of the Cubiquity for Unity3D documentation can be found here: http://www.cubiquity.net/cubiquity-for-unity3d/1.0/docs/

This folder contains PDF version of these pages, because the HTML versions contain JavaScript which confuses Unity because it is within the Assets folder. We remommend you refer to the online documentation above if possible because the hyperlinks work better.
