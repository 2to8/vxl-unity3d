 * %Cubiquity for Unity3D is designed to be as easy and intuitive as possible, and so this quick start guide should be all you need to begin creating voxel worlds for your games. If you have any difficulties or wish to follow up some topics in more depth then you can see the appropriate sections of this user manual for more details.
 * 
 * \section secInstall Download and Install
 * 
 * There are currently two ways of obtaining Cubiquity for Unity3D. You can either download and install a '.unitypackage' file (available on the Asset Store or from our website), or get the latest development version from our git repository.
 *
 * \subsection secInstallFromPackage Installing a Package File
 *
 * When purchasing Cubiquity for Unity3D on the Asset Store you are immediately provided with an option to install. If you instead choose to save the package file for later use, or if you choose to download the non-commercial version of Cubiquity for Unity3D from our website, then you need to import the package file by going to the main menu in the Unity3D editor and selecting `Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package..` and then locating your downloaded package file. The unity package importer will then present you with a list of files which you can choose to import - for now the best option is to make sure everything is selected and then press `Import`.
 *
 * The process we have described here is standard for all Unity3D packages, so if you have any difficulties you should consult the Unity3D documentation.
 *
 * \subsection secInstallFromGit Installing from Git
 *
 * Advanced users may be interested in using the latest development version of Cubiquity for Unity3D, rather than the stable releases. By doing this you may get access to functionality before it is officially released, but you can should expect that this is not yet fully tested. If you are interested in this then you can find our Git repository at https://bitbucket.org/volumesoffun/cubiquity-for-unity3d where further instructions are also provided.
