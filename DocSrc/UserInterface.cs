/** \page pageUserInterface User Interface
 *
  * %Cubiquity for Unity3D is tightly coupled with the Unity3D editor and strives to follow similar design and usage approaches to those used in other parts of Unity. This means that concepts such as component-based design, assets, inspectors, transform gizmos, and materials should all work in similar way to those which you are used to, and the interface to the TerrainVolume also takes significant cues from Unity's standard terrain.
 *
 * We hope that you will therefore find the system intuitive, but none-the-less we use this section of the manual to outline the key user interface elements and how they fit together.
